                Close sources indicated that the President could or could not be alive earlier this day. Turns out this rumor is originated from a german spy, with code name "Schrodinger". "Fake news!", said the POTUS, once he was questioned about his death.

                A national scale event happened this Saturday in Huntsville, Alabama where thousands gathered for a meat festival. Naturally the visitors had a rally of vegans protesting this festival on the spot, shouting and flashing explicit boards. "People need meat, it's been like this since forever. We aren't going to stop now. These 'veganese' are making a big 'missteak'!", said Ronald King, organizer of this event. No representant of the vegan community has step foward in a orderly manner to answer back to this statement.
